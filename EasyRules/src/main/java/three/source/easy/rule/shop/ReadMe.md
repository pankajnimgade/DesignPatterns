In this tutorial, we have a shop application and we would like to implement the following requirement: deny children from buying alcohol. The minimal legal age to be considered as adult is 18. This tutorial is split in two parts:

    Part 1: Implement the business rule of denying children from buying alcohol
    Part 2: Make the legal age configurable via JMX so we can change it at runtime
